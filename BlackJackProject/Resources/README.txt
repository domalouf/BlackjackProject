Welcome to my Blackjack Simulator and Teacher Program!

Strategy:
This class holds the moves that come from the basic strategy table.
Its constructor is very specific for the file format given by BasicStrategyChart.txt in Resources.
I hope there is a better way of reading in charts to 2D arrays because my method was very arduous to implement.

MVC Architecture:
This program uses Model View Controller to handle seperation of concerns for the different projects.
View has a reference to model and controller
Controller has a reference to model
Model is j chillin

TODO:
make basic view that can take in what cards are in play and give player the correct move to make
