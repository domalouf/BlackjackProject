Welcome to my Blackjack Simulator and Teacher Program!

Strategy:
This class holds the moves that come from the basic strategy table.
Its constructor is very specific to read in the file given by BasicStrategyChart.txt in Resources.
I hope there is a better way of reading in charts to 2D arrays because my method was very arduous to implement.

MVC Architecture:
This program uses Model View Controller to handle seperation of concerns for the different projects.
View has a reference to model and controller
Controller has a reference to model
Model is j chillin

TODO:
make basic view that can take in what cards are in play and give player the correct move to make (DONE)
give player ability to hit until 21

have different tools in different windows, so not all crammed in the same designer
different tools like deal cards or get basic strategy
