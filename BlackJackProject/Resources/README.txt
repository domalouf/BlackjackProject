Welcome to my Blackjack Simulator and Teacher Program!

Strategy:
This class holds the moves that come from the basic strategy table.
Its constructor is very specific for the file format given by BasicStrategyChart.txt in Resources.
I hope there is a better way of reading in charts to 2D arrays because my method was very arduous to implement.
